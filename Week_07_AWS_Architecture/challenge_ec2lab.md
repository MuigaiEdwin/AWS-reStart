# 🚀 Amazon EC2 Instances Challenge Lab

This repository documents the steps, configurations, and results of my **AWS re/Start EC2 Challenge Lab**, where I deployed a simple web application on an **Amazon Linux EC2 instance** running an **Apache (httpd)** web server.

---

## 🧭 Lab Overview

In this challenge, I created and configured a virtual network, launched an Amazon EC2 instance, installed a web server, and deployed a simple HTML webpage.

**Objectives**
- Configure a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Place an Amazon Linux EC2 instance in that VPC
- Install and configure an Apache web server
- Deploy and run a simple web application

---

## 🕐 Duration

Approx. **45 minutes**

---

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Network Configuration
- Created a **VPC** with IPv4 CIDR `10.0.0.0/16`
- Created a **public subnet** `10.0.1.0/24`
- Created and attached an **Internet Gateway** to the VPC
- Created a **Route Table** with a route to `0.0.0.0/0` via the Internet Gateway
- Associated the route table with the public subnet
- Enabled **Auto-assign Public IPv4 address** for the subnet

---

### 2️⃣ Security Group Configuration
- Created a **Security Group** named `reStart-sg`
- Allowed the following inbound traffic:
  - **SSH (TCP 22)** — from my IP address
  - **HTTP (TCP 80)** — from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`)
- Allowed all outbound traffic

---

### 3️⃣ Launching the EC2 Instance
- **AMI:** Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM)
- **Instance Type:** t3.micro
- **Storage:** 8 GiB General Purpose SSD (gp2)
- **Network:** reStart-VPC and reStart-subnet
- **Public IPv4:** Enabled
- **Security Group:** reStart-sg

**User Data Script used during launch:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
chmod 777 /var/www/html
````

---

### 4️⃣ Verifying Installation

After launch, I viewed the **system log** and confirmed that `httpd` was successfully installed and started.

Commands used for verification:

```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
sudo ss -tlnp | grep :80
curl -I http://localhost
```

The `curl` response confirmed Apache was running:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache/2.4.65 (Amazon Linux)
```

---

### 5️⃣ Deploying the Web Application

I created a simple HTML file named `projects.html` and placed it in the `/var/www/html` directory.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Edwin Muigai's re/Start Project Work</h1>
<p>EC2 Instance Challenge Lab</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Commands:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > projects.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Edwin Muigai's re/Start Project Work</h1>
<p>EC2 Instance Challenge Lab</p>
</body>
</html>
EOF

sudo mv projects.html /var/www/html/projects.html
sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/projects.html
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

---

### 6️⃣ Testing the Application

Opened the following URL in the browser:

```
http://<PUBLIC_IPV4>/projects.html
```

✅ The web page loaded successfully, displaying my name and the lab project title.
